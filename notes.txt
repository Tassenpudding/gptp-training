audio video bridging
time sensitive networking

ntp to sync time between a pc and a server

more accurate but local

e.g. infotainment or festivals, concerts

PTP i go not into details

PTP for local systems that need better accuracy then NTP

ptp time is based on the international atomic time
so basically nanoseconds since 1970-01-01

generic precision time protocol

gPTP IEEE 802.1AS based on PTP IEEE1588

time synchronisation via ethernet
point to point protocol

hardware needs to support this
you receive the timestamp of the sent or received packet

i do not explain the protocol in detail
i will explain the basics of the procedure to get the clock synchronized
